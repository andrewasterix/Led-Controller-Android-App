# Led Controller Android App
 24-Key remote controller app for Led Strips

This "new" app for controlling LED strips is aimed at those who do not have or have lost the 24-Key IR remote control (16 Colors + 4 Modes + 2 Brightness + 2 Power) and the LED strip does not have a control remote with Alexa, Google or others.

## Verified operation:
 - Star Wars 3D Lamps

## Bug:
 - Light Green (No. 10 Button) is not recognized as an IR code

## Future improvements (maybe):
 - Graphics (I have no great imagination :))
 - Bugs (Obviously)
